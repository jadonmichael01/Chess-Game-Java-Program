NAME: JadonMichael De Jesus

In this project, I built a Java program that uses inheritance and polymorphism to implement the Chess game. My program keeps track of pieces on the chess board from the time that game begins until the time that players make their final moves/captures. The program prevents the players from making illegal moves.

For this project I have implemented the  commands: "new game PLAYER1 PLAYER2", the "mv a0b0a1b1" command, the "cp a0b0a1b1" command, the "undo" command, and the "print status command"

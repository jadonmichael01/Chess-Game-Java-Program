For this assignment I have implemented the required commands: "new game PLAYER1 PLAYER2", the "mv a0b0a1b1" command, the "cp a0b0a1b1" command, the "undo" command, and the "print status command"

The parts I did not do were the %30 bonus parts. I did not implement promotion, en passant move, and the "check" message for when a king is in check

NAME: JadonMichael De Jesus

In this project, I built a Java program that uses inheritance and polymorphism to implement the Chess game. My program keeps track of the pieces on the chess board from the start of the game until the players make their final moves/captures. The program prevents the players from engaging in illegal behavior.

For this project I have implemented the  commands: "new game PLAYER1 PLAYER2", the "mv a0b0a1b1" command, the "cp a0b0a1b1" command, the "undo" command, and the "print status command"
